The program succesfully solves any given scramble in ca. 20 moves.
The problematic cases appear when the solution doesn't take many moves, e.g. the 
cube can be solved in 4 moves, but the solution is found in 12 moves. The problem is
that the algorithm works in 2 phases. In the first phase the main goal isn't to solve
the whole cube, but to bring it to the subgroup H1 which sometimes is done suboptimally.
Examples:
R L U2 D' -> D R L F2 R2 U2 R2 F2 R2 U2 F2 L2
R -> R U2 D2 R2 L2 U2 D2 L2

Superflip: U R2 F B R B2 R U2 L B2 R U' D' R2 F R' L B2 U2 F2
